#### What is the difference between `@escaping` and `@nonescaping` closures?
- @ecaping: The closure can outlive the function it’s passed to.
- @nonecaping: The closure is executed before the function returns and can’t escape the function’s scope.
	Example: 
	func addUser(completion: @escaping () → ()) { 
	 DispatchQueue.global().async {
	     completion() // Execute asynchronously
	 }
	}
